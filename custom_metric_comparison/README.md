# Custom Metric Comparison

In order to compare 2 different metrics which are already ingested into New Relic, you can leverage this example.

To deploy the example, you can refer to the [`deploy.sh`](/custom_metric_comparison/deploy.sh) script!

In order to just plan the script, run with the flag `--dry-run` and in order to delete the resources run with the flag `--destroy`.
